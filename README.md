Design Decisions

Zodiac Auto-detection: Simplified zodiac calculation using month/day ranges on signup.

In-memory Horoscope Data: Avoided DB overhead for static horoscope text for fast prototype.

Rate-Limiting Middleware: In-memory limiter to prevent spammy requests per user.

JWT Authentication: Stateless, scalable, and secure token-based authentication.

MongoDB + Mongoose: Flexible NoSQL setup for quick prototyping and future schema changes.

7-Day History Tracking: Stores recent horoscopes per user to allow reference and reduce repeated computation.

Modular Architecture: Separated routes, middleware, and utilities for maintainability and extensibility.

Simple API-first Approach: Focused on backend API design to support multiple clients (web/mobile).


Potential Improvements

Personalized Horoscopes: Generate user-specific horoscopes using birth charts or AI models.

Persistent Storage: Replace in-memory storage with a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL) for durability.

Dynamic Content Generation: Use AI for engaging and personalized horoscope messages.

Multi-Language Support: Expand for global users.

Advanced Rate Limiting & Caching: Use distributed caches (Redis) for scaling and better performance.

Analytics & Logging: Track API usage, user engagement, and popular horoscopes.

Scalability Considerations

Database Indexing: Quickly retrieve user-specific data.

Caching: Reduce DB load by caching zodiac-specific or precomputed horoscope content.

Microservices: Separate authentication, horoscope generation, and history services to scale independently.

Horizontal Scaling: Stateless JWT allows multiple server instances behind a load balancer.

Asynchronous Processing: Precompute AI-generated personalized horoscopes for large user bases to avoid latency.
